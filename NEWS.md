# cppDE 0.8.2

* `solveODE()` integrates a model and returns states with first and second
  order parameter sensitivities.
* `diagnostics()` prints the solver statistics.

# cppDE 0.8.1

* `cppODE()` and `cvode()` generate, compile and load a solver for an ODE
  system and return a model handle.

# cppDE 0.8.0

* `compile()` builds generated sources through `R CMD SHLIB`.
* Native symbol lookups are cached; `clearNativeSymbols()` drops the cache.

# cppDE 0.7.10

* C++ generation for ODE, CVODE and funCpp models, with common
  subexpression elimination and Jacobian sparsity detection.

# cppDE 0.7.9

* `derivSymb()` exposes symbolic first and second derivatives through SymPy.

# cppDE 0.7.8

* Event engine with saltation corrections, root finding and PCHIP forcings.

# cppDE 0.7.7

* Rosenbrock4 and Tsit5 single-step steppers with embedded error estimate
  and dense output.

# cppDE 0.7.6

* Variable-order BDF/NDF and Adams multistep steppers in Nordsieck form,
  with a Newton corrector.

# cppDE 0.7.5

* AD aware dense LU through LAPACK and sparse LU through KLU.

# cppDE 0.7.4

* Thread-local bump arena and contiguous tangent slab as tangent storage.

# cppDE 0.7.3

* `dual2nd<T, N>` for second order sensitivities.

# cppDE 0.7.2

* Expression templates collapse right-hand side temporaries into one fused
  chain-rule loop.

# cppDE 0.7.1

* Forward-mode dual numbers `dual<T, N>` for first order sensitivities,
  with a static and a heap allocated specialisation.

# cppDE 0.7.0

* Package skeleton and licence.
